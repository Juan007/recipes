- 1kg chuck roast joint
- 1 1⁄2 tbsp garlic
- 240 g onions

### Whipped Parsnips Ingredients

- 830g parsnips
- 1 1⁄2 tbsp garlic
- 3⁄4 tsp ground cumin
- 3 tsp oregano
- 3 tbsp greek yogurt
- 1 1⁄2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 130g chicken stock (low sodium)
- Sea salt
- Pepper
- Dried chives

## Main Preparation

1. Sprinkle sea salt & pepper on the chuck roast beef or bison.
2. Set multifunction cooker to Saute (or set a nonstick skillet on high heat). Spray it with olive oil, then add in the roast. Sear on both sides for 2 to 3 minutes. If you are cooking in a skillet, add the roast to the pressure cooker (or slow cooker).
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the pressure cooker, give it a quick stir, then place on the lid and cook for 20 to 25 minutes. (Note: adjust the cooking time according to the instructions on your pressure cooker)
4. If you do not have a pressure cooker, use a slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours.
5. Release the pressure, then gently pull apart the meat or cut it up on a plate. Then, add it back to the broth of the pressure cooker to marinate and meld.

### Whipped Parsnips Preparation

1. Chop parsnips into small 1.5 cm pieces. The best way is to chop them horizontally, then cut those chunks into halves or quarters depending on their size. The middle part of parsnips tend to be tough so you cut them up like this to ensure the middle part softens as well.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil, then toss in parsnips. Boil for 15 to 20 minutes, until they can easily be pierced with a fork. Drain them and allow them to cool.
3. Place the parsnips in a food processor along with the rest of the ingredients. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with sea salt & pepper.
4. Cook asparagus or your favorite green veggies, then evenly divide everything among your meal containers.
