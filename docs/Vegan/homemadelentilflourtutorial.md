## Ingredients

- 3 cups dry lentils of your choosing (I used green.)

## Preparation

You can make this flour two ways.
Leave the lentils un-toasted and transfer to a food processor. Working in batches, process until the lentils resemble a fine powder. There will be some bigger chunks left behind, so make sure to sift through a sieve. Store in an airtight container.
If you would like to make toasted lentil flour, preheat oven to 400F. Place lentils onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone mat. Sort into a single layer.
Bake for 10 minutes and stir. Bake for an additional 5 minutes if necessary.
Process like you would the un-toasted lentils.
*NOTE: Processing these lentils will take some time. Your food processor will probably heat up. Give it a break and step away for 15-20 minutes and process some more. I usually do this over a couple of days.
