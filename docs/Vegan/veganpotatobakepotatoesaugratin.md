## Ingredients

- 2 lbs Potatoes (750 g) (peeled)
- 1 Zucchini (200 g) (or sub more potatoes or other veggies)
- 7 oz Mushrooms (200 g) (optional)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion (sliced)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 1 cup cashews * (140 g) (soaked in hot water for 20 minutes)
- 1 cup vegetable broth (240 ml)
- 1 cup non-dairy milk (240 ml) (or water)
- 1/2 tsp salt (plus more to taste)
- pepper to taste
- 4 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)
- 4 tbsp Vegan Cheese (optional)
- fresh chives (optional)
- pine nuts (optional)

## Preparation

Preheat oven to 355°F (180°C) and grease a baking dish* with a little oil.
Prepare the Veggies:
Thinly slice zucchini and very thinly slice potatoes. (Zucchini should be sliced a bit thicker than potatoes.) *
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add onion and mushrooms and fry for about 4-5 minutes, until lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for another minute while stirring, then set aside.
Make the Cashew sauce:
Drain and rinse the cashews. Put them into a blender along with non-dairy milk, vegetable broth, salt, pepper, and nutritional yeast. Blend for a few minutes until smooth.
Assemble the Gratin and bake:
Heat up the cashew sauce in a pot (optionally, to reduce the baking time).
Spread half of the sliced potatoes and zucchini in the baking dish. Top evenly with half of the cashew sauce, then spread over the onions, garlic and mushrooms. Layer the rest of the potatoes and zucchini, then the rest of the mushrooms and sauce. (Make sure that the veggies are well covered with the sauce).
Bake the potato bake for about 50 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender and soft. (If it gets too brown during baking, cover the dish with tin foil or baking paper. But note that the potatoes need more time to cook through when the dish is covered).
Optionally, sprinkle vegan cheese over a few minutes before done and continue baking until melted, about 5-10 minutes.
Garnish with chopped chives and toasted pine nuts or other toppings you like.
Enjoy!
