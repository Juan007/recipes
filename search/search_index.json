Sprinkle yeast on top. Wait for 10 minutes or until it gets all foamy. Pour into a large bowl. Add flour, salt, olive oil. Combine. Knead for 6-8 minutes until you have a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (add a bit more flour if you need to). Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes. Lightly grease two 12-inch pizza pans. Sprinkle with a little bit of cornmeal. Divide dough in half. Place each half on a pizza pan and pat it with your fingers until it stretches over the whole pan. Try to make it thicker around the edge. If desired, pre-bake at 425 F for 10 minutes (I don't always do this). Then spread with pizza sauce and use the toppings of your choice. Bake at 425 F for 10-20 minutes longer or until bubbly and hot. Makes 2 12-inch pizzas. If you don't want to use all the dough, you can freeze it. Take a portion of dough, form into a ball, rub olive oil over it and place it in a freezer bag (the oil makes it easier to take out of the bag). When you want to make a pizza, take dough out of freezer and allow to thaw before using.","title":"Pizza Dough for Thin Crust Pizza"},{"location":"pizzadoughforthincrustpizza/#pizza-dough-for-thin-crust-pizza","text":"","title":"Pizza Dough for Thin Crust Pizza"},{"location":"pizzadoughforthincrustpizza/#meta","text":"Website Total time: 75 Nutrient Value calories 610.1 fatContent 5.2 saturatedFatContent 0.7 cholesterolContent 0 sodiumContent 299.2 carbohydrateContent 120.7 fiberContent 5.2 sugarContent 0.4 proteinContent 17.6","title":"Meta"},{"location":"pizzadoughforthincrustpizza/#ingredients","text":"2 1\u20442 cups all-purpose flour (may substitute whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose) 1 (1/4 ounce) package active dry yeast 1\u20444 teaspoon salt 1 cup warm water 1\u20442 - 1 tablespoon olive oil cornmeal, for sprinkling","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"pizzadoughforthincrustpizza/#preparation","text":"Mix a little sugar into the warm water.

Whisk to combine. Add 1 1/2 cups of water and whisk until smooth. Lightly oil 20cm (8 inch) x 20cm (8 inch) square baking dish or cake tin. Bring the remaining 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chickpea flour and water mixture. Whisk over the heat until the mixture becomes really thick and glossy. This should take about 8 minutes. Pour immediately into the prepared baking dish and leave to cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour. The longer it sits, the more water will drain out of the tofu and the firmer it will get. Cut into whatever size and shape you like. This will depend on how you are going to use it. I cut it into 2 to 3 cm cubes. Store in an airtight container and use within 3 days.
