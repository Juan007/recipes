Whisk to combine. Add 1 1/2 cups of water and whisk until smooth. Lightly oil 20cm (8 inch) x 20cm (8 inch) square baking dish or cake tin. Bring the remaining 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chickpea flour and water mixture. Whisk over the heat until the mixture becomes really thick and glossy. This should take about 8 minutes. Pour immediately into the prepared baking dish and leave to cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour. The longer it sits, the more water will drain out of the tofu and the firmer it will get. Cut into whatever size and shape you like. This will depend on how you are going to use it. I cut it into 2 to 3 cm cubes. Store in an airtight container and use within 3 days. Some commenters have had success freezing it, but it is not something I have tried myself.","title":"Burmese Chickpea Tofu recipe (soy free tofu) {vegan + dairy free + gluten free}"},{"location":"burmesechickpeatofurecipesoyfreetofuvegandairyfreeglutenfree/#burmese-chickpea-tofu-recipe-soy-free-tofu-vegan-dairy-free-gluten-free","text":"","title":"Burmese Chickpea Tofu recipe (soy free tofu) {vegan + dairy free + gluten free}"},{"location":"burmesechickpeatofurecipesoyfreetofuvegandairyfreeglutenfree/#meta","text":"Website Total time: 25 Yields: 6 serving(s) Nutrient Value calories 77 kcal carbohydrateContent 11 g proteinContent 4 g fatContent 1 g sodiumContent 406 mg fiberContent 2 g sugarContent 2 g servingSize 1 serving","title":"Meta"},{"location":"burmesechickpeatofurecipesoyfreetofuvegandairyfreeglutenfree/#ingredients","text":"1 cup chickpea flour (garbanzo bean flour / besan flour) 1 tsp salt 1/4 tsp ground turmeric (optional) 3 cups water (divided) neutral flavoured oil such as canola, sunfower (safflower)","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"burmesechickpeatofurecipesoyfreetofuvegandairyfreeglutenfree/#preparation","text":"Place the chickpea flour in a bowl along with the salt and turmeric (if using).

Preparation You can make this flour two ways. Leave the lentils un-toasted and transfer to a food processor. Working in batches, process until the lentils resemble a fine powder. There will be some bigger chunks left behind, so make sure to sift through a sieve. Store in an airtight container. If you would like to make toasted lentil flour, preheat oven to 400F. Place lentils onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone mat. Sort into a single layer. Bake for 10 minutes and stir. Bake for an additional 5 minutes if necessary. Process like you would the un-toasted lentils. *NOTE: Processing these lentils will take some time. Your food processor will probably heat up. Give it a break and step away for 15-20 minutes and process some more. I usually do this over a couple of days.","title":"Homemade Lentil Flour Tutorial"},{"location":"Vegan/homemadelentilflourtutorial/#homemade-lentil-flour-tutorial","text":"","title":"Homemade Lentil Flour Tutorial"},{"location":"Vegan/homemadelentilflourtutorial/#meta","text":"Website Total time: 20 Yields: 1 serving(s)","title":"Meta"},{"location":"Vegan/homemadelentilflourtutorial/#ingredients","text":"3 cups dry lentils of your choosing (I used green.)","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"Vegan/homemadelentilflourtutorial/#preparation","text":"You can make this flour two ways.
